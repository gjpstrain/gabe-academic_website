I am a current MRes Psychology Student at the University of Manchester, with a view to pursuing academic research as a career. My research interests include data science and visualisation, statistics, and perception. My undergraduate dissertation investigated whether slanted titles could affect student's perceptions of correlation strength in scatterplots. My current research focuses on ascertaining how people extract meaning from data visualisations.
