title: Celebrating my PhD offer
subtitle: After several months of writes and re-writes, I finally got my PhD proposal approved with my supervisors and was offered an interview for funding with the computer science department here at UoM a few weeks ago. It was hard to tell just how well the interview went, but a few weeks later (last Tuesday), I finally recieved an email offering me full funding on a University scholarship for a PhD in computer science starting this September! I am completely over the moon - since I've been doing my MRes I have really falled in love with research, and I can't imagine anything more exciting than doing it professionally.

Above is a link to my LinkedIn post following my offer - I really didn't expect to get this level of engagement, but the supportive comments people left really made my day.
