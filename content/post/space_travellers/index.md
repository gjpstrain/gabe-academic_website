title: Gender Equality in Space
subtitle: I completed a Hackathon as part of a recent university assignment. I chose to work with the TidyTuesday astronauts [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/astronauts.csv). This is a huge dataset with loads of interesting variables - I also did some modeling, which revealed no effect of gender on either total mission time nor total EVA time, which is a big win for gender equality in the final frontier!

## Some details

This plot was produced using Rstudio, with the `ggimage`, `ggplot2`, `ggtext`, `magick`, and `tidyverse` packages. Figuring out how to create the flag bar and set the background was a real challenge, but it taught me a lot about working within the tidyverse and the more finicky details of `dplyr`.
