 Above is the title page from my undergraduate dissertation. I carried out an experiment to determine if having biased titles affects how people perceive correlation strength in scatterplots. This was my first foray into doing any kind of actual academic research, and the experience really sparked my interest in pursuing it as a career. This project made me really excited about the field of data science, and starting to learn how to code made me want to combine my psychology experience with the field of Human Computer Interaction, or HCI.

 My findings for my undergraduate project ended up being pretty uninteresting, but that doesn't mean it is any less valid as a piece of research! I ended up with quite a high mark, so it's the thing I'm probably most proud of at the moment, especially as it was completed during a pandemic!
